## regression models

- statistical tools used to establish relationships between variables, typically to predict value of a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.
- these models are foundational in both statistical analysis and machine learning, serving purposes such as prediction, forecasting, and understanding casual realtionships.

### types of regression models

- linear regression: most common form, assumes a linear relationship between variables
- nonlinear regression
- ridge regression
- logistic regression

### applications of regression models

- finance: for asset valuation and predicting market trends
- healthcare: analyze impact of various factors on disease risk
- business: forecasting sales, understanding market dynamics
