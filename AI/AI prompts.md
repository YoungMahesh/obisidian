### Prompt generation
- create your **personalized “Power Prompt Pack”** so I can get the most value out of our chats every day.  

Here is a little background so you can tailor it perfectly for me:  

1. **Profession / Field of Work** – What do you primarily do?  
2. **Main Goals** – What are you aiming to achieve with our conversations? (e.g., productivity, learning, content creation, career growth)  
3. **Key Interests / Hobbies** – Any personal areas you want prompts for?  
4. **Preferred Style** – Short and concise answers, detailed deep dives, or a mix?  
5. **Typical Output Format** – Do you prefer tables, bullet points, narratives, scripts, or something else?
