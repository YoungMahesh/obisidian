# Binary Operators
Binary operators are fundamental elements in computer programming.
They are called "binary" because they operate on two operands, meaning they require two inputs to perform a specific operation.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

### 2. Relational Operators
- Equal to (==)
- Not equal to (!=)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

### 3. Logical Operators
- AND (&&)
- OR (||)
- NOT (!)


### 4. Bitwise Operators
- AND (&) 
- OR (|)
- XOR (^)
- Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits of the first operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the second operand.
- Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits of the first operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the second operand.
- NOT(~) is not part of this list, as it is a unary operator, it operates on a single operand

### 5. Assignment Operators
- Assignment (=)
- Compound assignments (+=, -=, *=, /=)
