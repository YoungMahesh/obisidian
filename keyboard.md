### Redragon keyboard

- `Fn + Alt` Change color theme
- `Super+Fn`: lock `Super` key
- `Fn2+9`: change back-light color mode
- `Fn2+-`: reduce brightness
- `Fn2++`: increase brightness
- `Fn2+0`: toggle back-light

### ANT esports keyboard
- `Fn+w` toggle `a w d s` to `left-arrow up-arrow right-arrow down-arrow`
- `Fn+Ctrl-l` 
	- what happens
		- shift numbers with Fn keys (e.g. when 1 is presses, Fn+1 gets executed)
		- Other Fn related keys in center-right, (e.g. upon i press, fn+i gets executed)
	- How to Perform the Key Combination
		- Place one finger on the Fn key
		- Place another finger on the CTRL key (on bottom-left, not bottom-right).
		- While holding both, press the L key once.
		- Release both Fn and Ctrl keys.
- problems
	- some keymaps like `ctrl+shift-p` only works when time different between pressing `ctrl+shift` and `p` is short

- if some function get executed which you don't know how to turn off such as `i` is behaving as `Pause`, then plug-off and plug-in keyboard, this will reset the functionality
