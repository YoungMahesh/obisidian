## why not obsidian?

### 1. problem in custom vim-motions

I prefer to use custom vim motion while writing/editing notes.
Obsidian by default does not support custom vim-motions.
[obsidian-vimrc-support](https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-vimrc-support) enables custom vim motions on obisdian.
But, one custom keymap (9 to move cursor to end of line) is not working.

### 2. editor freeze

Obsidian editor hangs suddenly while working with vim-mode on ubuntu snap-package.
This happens very frequently

## Advantages of obsidian

- Better UI than neovim, vscode for markdown editing
- notes can be published in graph-view using [digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin
