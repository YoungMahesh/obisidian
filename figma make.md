#ai-model
### why figma make is not worth the price?
- it provides live design to code feature, but when we download code, images are not included in it, we need to spend time to manually extract images from design import them into the code

### in which price is worth it?
- we have lot of continuous stream of projects (so we can pay for subscription every month) which can be hosted on figma-sites

### alternatives
- google-gemini ( #ai-model ) provides canvas mode which is similar to figma-make
- t3-chat  can be used where we can provide design, images, current-code, current-UI screenshot and ask it to modify code such that we get expected design
