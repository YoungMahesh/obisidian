### Ethernet cable connector - RJ45

Most common household Ethernet cables—such as Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat6a—do use RJ45 connectors.

Key points about Ethernet cable connector compatibility:  
- RJ45 connectors (formally 8P8C connectors) are the standard for most Ethernet cables from Cat3 up through Cat6a. They have 8 positions and 8 contacts to connect the twisted pairs in the cable.  
- Cat7 cables can use RJ45 connectors, but often use a specialized version called GG45 or ARJ45 connectors designed for higher frequency and better shielding, although these are backward compatible with RJ45 as well.  
- Cat8.1 uses standard RJ45 connectors and is backward compatible with Cat6a and Cat7 standards. However, Cat8.2 does not use the standard RJ45 connector.  
- RJ45 connectors come in different types for different cable categories, including shielded versus unshielded, and for solid or stranded conductors. For example, for Cat6 and Cat6a, pass-through RJ45 connectors are recommended.  
- The connector type must match the cable's specifications for diameter, conductor type, and shielding to ensure proper fit and performance.

### Ethernet cable types

The most common types of Ethernet cables used for household networking in India are as follows:

1. Cat5 (Category 5)
- Offers speeds up to 100 Mbps
- Suitable for basic internet browsing and streaming
- Becoming outdated but still available and economical

2. Cat5e (Category 5 enhanced)
- Supports speeds up to 1 Gbps
- Reduces interference compared to Cat5
- Commonly used in many home networks today
- Popular economical choice for gigabit networking

3. Cat6 (Category 6)
- Supports speeds up to 10 Gbps on shorter distances (up to 55 meters)
- Better insulation and reduced interference
- Ideal for gaming, HD video streaming, and home offices
- Increasingly popular in India due to performance benefits

4. Cat6a (Category 6 augmented)
- Supports 10 Gbps speeds over longer distances (up to 100 meters)
- Enhanced shielding to minimize interference
- Suitable for high-speed, reliable connections in larger homes or office setups

5. Cat7 (Category 7)
- Supports speeds up to 10 Gbps with higher frequency (600 MHz)
- Shielded cable with improved protection against interference
- Generally used for more demanding setups like data centers but also available for home use where high reliability is necessary

Additionally, Ethernet cables come in different physical styles such as flat or round cables, and can be stranded or solid core, with solid core being better for fixed structured wiring within walls.

For typical household use in India, Cat5e and Cat6 cables are the most common choices due to their balance of speed, cost, and availability. Cat6a and Cat7 are used for more advanced or demanding networking needs.
