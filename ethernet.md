### Ethernet cable types

The most common types of Ethernet cables used for household networking in India are as follows:

1. Cat5 (Category 5)
- Offers speeds up to 100 Mbps
- Suitable for basic internet browsing and streaming
- Becoming outdated but still available and economical

2. Cat5e (Category 5 enhanced)
- Supports speeds up to 1 Gbps
- Reduces interference compared to Cat5
- Commonly used in many home networks today
- Popular economical choice for gigabit networking

3. Cat6 (Category 6)
- Supports speeds up to 10 Gbps on shorter distances (up to 55 meters)
- Better insulation and reduced interference
- Ideal for gaming, HD video streaming, and home offices
- Increasingly popular in India due to performance benefits

4. Cat6a (Category 6 augmented)
- Supports 10 Gbps speeds over longer distances (up to 100 meters)
- Enhanced shielding to minimize interference
- Suitable for high-speed, reliable connections in larger homes or office setups

5. Cat7 (Category 7)
- Supports speeds up to 10 Gbps with higher frequency (600 MHz)
- Shielded cable with improved protection against interference
- Generally used for more demanding setups like data centers but also available for home use where high reliability is necessary

Additionally, Ethernet cables come in different physical styles such as flat or round cables, and can be stranded or solid core, with solid core being better for fixed structured wiring within walls.

For typical household use in India, Cat5e and Cat6 cables are the most common choices due to their balance of speed, cost, and availability. Cat6a and Cat7 are used for more advanced or demanding networking needs.
