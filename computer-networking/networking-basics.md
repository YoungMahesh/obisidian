## **1. What is Computer Networking?**
A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, network devices, etc.) that communicate and share resources (data, files, printers, internet access) with each other.

---

## **2. Types of Networks**
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small area (e.g., office, home).
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large geographic areas (e.g., the Internet).
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Spans a city or campus.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Very small area, typically around a person (e.g., Bluetooth).

---

## **3. Network Topologies**
Arrangement of different elements (links, nodes, devices) in a computer network. The choice of topology affects the networkâ€™s performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and cost.

- **Bus:** All devices connected to a single backbone.
- **Star:** All devices connected to a central hub/switch.
- **Ring:** Devices connected in a circular fashion.
- **Mesh:** Every device connects to every other device.
- **Hybrid:** Combination of two or more topologies.

## **4. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**
A **conceptual** framework with **7 layers**:
1. **Physical:** Cables, switches, physical transmission.
2. **Data Link:** MAC addresses, switches, frames.
3. **Network:** IP addresses, routers, packets.
4. **Transport:** TCP/UDP, ports, segments.
5. **Session:** Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
6. **Presentation:** Data translation, encryption, compression.
7. **Application:** End-user applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

---

## **5. TCP/IP Model**
A simplified, **practical** model with **4 layers**:
1. **Network Interface (Link)**
2. **Internet**
3. **Transport**
4. **Application**

---

## **6. IP Addressing**
IP - Internet Protocol;    MAC - Media Access Control

- **IP Address:** Unique identifier for a device on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **IPv4:** 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- **IPv6:** 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **MAC Address:** Unique hardware address assigned to network interfaces.

---

## **7. Common Network Devices**
- **Router:** Connects different networks, routes data.
- **Switch:** Connects devices within a LAN, forwards data based on MAC addresses.
- **Hub:** Basic device that broadcasts data to all devices in a network.
- **Bridge:** Connects and filters traffic between two network segments.
- **Gateway:** Connects networks using different protocols.

---

## **8. Protocols**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable, connection-oriented.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Unreliable, connectionless, faster.
- **HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP, ARP, ICMP** (know what each does).

---

## **9. Network Communication**
- **Unicast:** One-to-one communication.
- **Broadcast:** One-to-all communication.
- **Multicast:** One-to-many communication (to a specific group).

---

## **10. Basic Networking Terms**
- **Bandwidth:** Maximum data transfer rate.
- **Latency:** Delay in data transmission.
- **Throughput:** Actual data transfer rate.
- **Packet:** Unit of data transmitted over a network.

---

### **Quick Tips for Interviews**
- Be able to explain the OSI and TCP/IP models and their layers.
- Know the difference between a switch, router, and hub.
- Understand the basics of IP addressing and subnetting.
- Be familiar with common protocols and their purposes.
