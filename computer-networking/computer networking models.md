Computer network models are used to represent how data is transmitted and processed between devices on a network. These models are essential for understanding how different network technologies work and for troubleshooting network issues. Two prominent examples are the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.

---

- **OSI** is a **theoretical, 7-layer model** used for understanding and teaching networking concepts.
- **TCP/IP** is a **practical, 4-layer model** that forms the foundation of the Internet.

## **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**
- Developed by **ISO** (International Organization for Standardization).
- Conceptual model with **7 layers**.
- Used as a reference for understanding and designing network protocols.

### **When was it published?**
- **Development started:** Late 1970s
- **Published:** **1984** by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** as ISO standard **ISO 7498**.

### **Purpose**
- To provide a **universal, vendor-neutral framework** for designing and understanding network protocols and communication.
- To **standardize networking** so that devices and software from different manufacturers could interoperate.
- To **break down network communication** into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions, making it easier to develop, troubleshoot, and teach networking concepts.

## **TCP/IP Model (Internet Protocol Suite)**
- Developed by the **U.S. Department of Defense**.
- Practical model with **4 layers** (sometimes described as 5).
- Basis for the modern Internet.

### **When was it published?**
- **Development started:** Early 1970s (as part of the ARPANET project)
- **Key protocols (TCP and IP) specified:** **1974** (first paper published by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn)
- **Adopted as standard:** **1983** (U.S. Department of Defense made TCP/IP the standard for ARPANET)
- **Formal documentation:** RFCs (Request for Comments), especially **RFC 791 (IP)** and **RFC 793 (TCP)**, both published in **1981**.

### **Purpose**
- To create a **robust, scalable, and interoperable protocol suite** for interconnecting different types of computer networks (the foundation of the Internet).
- To **enable reliable communication** across diverse and geographically distributed networks.
- To provide a **practical, implementation-focused model** for real-world networking, rather than just a theoretical framework.

## 2. Layer Structure

| OSI Model       | TCP/IP Model         | Function/Examples         |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 7. Application  | 4. Application       | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS      |
| 6. Presentation |                      | Encryption, Compression   |
| 5. Session      |                      | Session management        |
| 4. Transport    | 3. Transport         | TCP, UDP                  |
| 3. Network      | 2. Internet          | IP, ICMP, ARP             |
| 2. Data Link    | 1. Network Interface | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC      |
| 1. Physical     |                      | Cables, switches, signals |

- **Note:** In TCP/IP, the Application layer covers OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers. The Network Interface layer covers both Data Link and Physical layers.
